# ProbabilisticPriorityQueue
The Probabilistic Priority Queue Java library is a collection of classes allowing the construction of a class of priority queues with a random component to next element selection, according to programmatically-defined probability distributions. These classes provide a flexible framework for building probabilistic queues and underlying cumulative density functions.
